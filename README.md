# Airplane Management System

## Introduction

The Airplane Management System is a Python-based flight management and passenger booking system. It allows admins to add and view flight details, while passengers can book, view, and cancel flight reservations.

## Features

- Admin Features:

Add flight details (flight number, departure and arrival time, airline name, cities, and status).

View all available flights.

- Passenger Features:

Book a flight ticket with multiple options (one-way trip, different classes, discount fares).

View booked ticket details.

Cancel a booked ticket.

Automatic fare calculation based on age group and travel class.

## Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Modules: csv, random, datetime, time

Data Storage: CSV files (event.csv for flights, flight.csv for bookings, ticket.csv for tickets)

## Future Enhancements

- Implement a GUI for better user experience.

- Integrate with a database instead of CSV files.

- Add more payment and refund features.

- Implement user authentication for passengers and admins.
